# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# FRONTEND4 CONTEST 2

### Project Overview

1. Make a react project to display a counter on the screen, Make a component called CounterComponent() and pass props accordingly.
2. Use useState to make the counter state, The count should start from 0, Your useState and useEffect should be in App.js while all of the code for counter should be in a separate file.
3. console.log the value using a useEffect every time the value of the count changes.
4. Make 2 buttons, one to increment the number and one to decrement,
5. The number shouldn't go below 0, if it does give an alert to the user showing an error for the same
6. If the number is greater than 10, conditionally render a third button which should say "GO BACK TO 0" and onclicking of that button, make the state go back to 0.
7. Make sure this button is not visible if the count is less than or equal to 10
